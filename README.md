# Movie App

A movie app made with HTML, SASS, vanilla JavaScript and Moviedb API. The app fetches top rated movies and allows user to see individual information (such as summary, language, rating, popularity and production) for each movie. It also allows users to rate each movie and see their previously rating. There is also the Movie Roulette option, which allows users to select a genre and get a random movie of that genre.
